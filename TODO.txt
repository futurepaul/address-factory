[ ] pretty print the address-factory.json
[ ] (hopefully) do path tab complete
[x] ask the bdk people how to skip to a specific index
[ ] make a suggestion of number to skip based on current factory state
[ ] if I ctrl-c to cancel clean up after myself?? do I revert the factory state???
[ ] use bdk's macro thing to build descriptor
[x] if I set it to skip addresses during setup when it validates derived vs expected it doesn't do the skipping
[ ] if I already have an address factory file at that path do I overwrite it? error out? write it with a diff name?
[ ] is there a better resource to point to for derivation path?
[ ] can I use serde to serialize desc?
[ ] probably don't even ask for fingerprint
[ ] use bdk macro to build descriptor
[ ] make 44 / 49 / 84 a selection instead of needing the whole path OR ACTUALLY if it's a ypub / zpub / xpub we should be able to do it automatically
