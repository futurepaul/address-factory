[x] pretty print the address-factory.json
[ ] (hopefully) do path tab complete
[x] ask the bdk people how to skip to a specific index
[x] make a suggestion of number to skip based on current factory state
[ ] if I ctrl-c to cancel clean up after myself?? do I revert the factory state???
[x] use bdk's macro thing to build descriptor
[x] if I set it to skip addresses during setup when it validates derived vs expected it doesn't do the skipping
[x] if I already have an address factory file at that path do I overwrite it? error out? write it with a diff name?
[ ] is there a better resource to point to for derivation path?
[x] can I use serde to serialize desc?
[ ] if pr gets accepted nice
[ ] probably don't even ask for fingerprint
[ ] make 44 / 49 / 84 a selection instead of needing the whole path OR ACTUALLY if it's a ypub / zpub / xpub we should be able to do it automatically
[ ] if you do two runs in the same minute it's an error because the filename for the db is a dupe
